# Goblin-Escape
In progress choose-your-own adventure game made in C++. I'm a fan of those old school Commodore 64 choose your own adventure stories and want to try making my own. I chose to do it this way because I wanted to challenge myself to write descriptive environment storytelling that visual novels are able to convey via images. 
This project uses pure C++ to bring up the CMD menu. What I want to do next is try to make it OS agnostic so it can run on the Mac and Linux terminal.
